Reflection

Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

I believe I achieved all main requirements, as well as including some basic metadata

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

Updating posts proved difficult, I was unsure of how to implement it on the client side

🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

Efficiency of next.js code and practices

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

Psuedo classes on modules seemed to be a bit weird, they didn't seem to work on the individual recipe links, and were overall hard to implement for unknown reasons.

Also when creating the delete button, I couldn't get it to work as a react component, I was getting an error saying "onClick was expecting a function, receieved an object", was unsure on how to fix it so had to abandon using a component. The DeleteButton.jsx file is still here, but unused.

Also the "go back" link on the individual recipes page has a problem, it successfully sends the user to the previous recipe category page, but the recipes don't load in for some reason. I couldn't figure out why

What went really well and what could have gone better?
